## Submitting Data ##
So, you have some data that you would like to submit to the [Linguistic Linked Open Data Cloud (LLOD)](http://linguistics.okfn.org/resources/llod/). Fantastic. Here's what you do:

  * Sign on to [the OKF CKAN Datahub](http://thedatahub.org) and make/sign into your account.
  * Submit your data ([here](http://thedatahub.org/en/dataset/new)).
  * Then, go to our [MLODE issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/mlode/issues/list), and add an issue, linking to your CKAN Datahub entry. You should select the **Add Dataset** template
  * If you encounter any problems, have a look at the [detailed workflow description](DetailedWorkflow.md)

You're done, at this point. We'll take a look at the entry; when it is accepted, we'll both let you know, and assign it to a developer. The developer will convert it into the appropriate RDF triplet format, and checked for errors. The data will then be added to the [LLOD cloud](http://linguistics.okfn.org/resources/llod/), and we're all set!
